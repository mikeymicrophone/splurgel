comments need to display replies and reply button

a cool way to make the comment reply box appear really fast would be to have it loaded already and hidden
however doing that for each comment is a significant commitment up front
so I could have a single comment box that would move into place and get informed about which comment it was targeting
but then users would always have to submit one comment before starting another
although I could override it to load a new form when the primary one wasn't submitted
and I think I will to speed up the site once it becomes popular
but for now I will just load the comment form by ajax


preferences for the default privacy of events (like when you add an item to your want list) could be saved in the users table using acts_as_bitfield or acts_as_bytefield

micro formats

better logic for who gets which websites in their websites partial (for making website_uses)
