* 0.04 - 04/29/2008
  - Fixed issue with access_denied not playing right with restful_authentication's.
    Since they really serve a different purpose, I simply renamed it. authorization_denied
    also now caches the call to next_authorized_url?

* 0.03 - 04/28/2008
  - Added :only_if_logged_in? key since logged_in? can't be tested via :if (scoping)
  - Added generator option --library-only to allow for "safe" library updating
  - Documented and enabled --skip-migration option

* 0.02 - 04/25/2008
  - Fixed documentation problems (require_foo instead of authorize_foo leftovers)
  - Correctly failing users who aren't logged in for all conditions
  - Fixed issue with has_role? leftover from role_requirement

*	0.01 - 04/21/2008

  - Initial release
  - Migrated from svn to git (Google Code -> GitHub)
